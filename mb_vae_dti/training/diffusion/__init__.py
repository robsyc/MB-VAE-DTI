"""
Diffusion model utilities for drug generation.

This module contains components for discrete diffusion models:
- Noise schedules for discrete molecular graphs
- Augmentation techniques for molecular data
- Utility functions for graph processing and training

TODO: this module is a mess, we need to clean it up.
Especially the utils resources need to be refactored.
